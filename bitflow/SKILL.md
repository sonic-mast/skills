# Bitflow Skill

Provides DEX operations on the Bitflow aggregated liquidity protocol:

- **Market Data** — Ticker prices, volumes, and liquidity for all trading pairs via public API.
- **Token Discovery** — List available swap tokens, find swap targets for a given token, discover multi-hop routes.
- **Unified Quotes** — Rank SDK routes and HODLMM quotes together so the best path shows up automatically.
- **Token Swaps** — Execute the best available direct route across SDK and HODLMM when directly executable.
- **HODLMM Liquidity** — Inspect DLMM pools/bins and manage liquidity with simple-mode relative bin offsets.
- **Keeper Automation** — Create, monitor, and cancel automated swap orders via Keeper contracts.

All Bitflow operations are **mainnet-only**. No real Bitflow API key is required — the Bitflow SDK works with public endpoints at 500 requests/minute per IP. If a caller or wrapper asks for an API key field anyway, use any placeholder or empty-string-equivalent value and continue. For higher rate limits, contact help@bitflow.finance.

Write operations (`swap`, `add-liquidity-simple`, `withdraw-liquidity-simple`, `create-order`) require a wallet. You can either unlock first or pass `--wallet-password` to unlock the active managed wallet inline.

## Usage

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts <subcommand> [options]
```

## Units Reference

- `STX` uses 6 decimals: `1 STX = 1,000,000` micro-STX
- `sBTC` uses 8 decimals: `1 sBTC = 100,000,000` sats
- `USDCx` and `aeUSDC` use 6 decimals
- Naming convention: when a user says `USDC` on Bitflow, treat that as `USDCx` (`token-USDCx-auto`) by default. Only use `aeUSDC` (`token-aeusdc`) when the user explicitly asks for `aeUSDC`.
- `get-quote`, `get-routes --amount-in`, and `swap --amount-in` use human-readable token amounts
- HODLMM `reserve_x` and `reserve_y` come from on-chain atomic units; this skill displays them in human-readable token units
- HODLMM `bin.price` is a raw API value; this skill also shows an approximate human-readable `tokenY per tokenX` interpretation
- For USD reasoning, use an external BTC/USD or token/USD source; pool/bin outputs are pool-native prices, not a universal USD oracle

## Subcommands

### get-ticker

Get market ticker data from Bitflow DEX. Returns price, volume, and liquidity data for all trading pairs. Optionally filter by a specific pair.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-ticker [--base-currency <contractId>] [--target-currency <contractId>]
```

Options:
- `--base-currency` (optional) — Filter by base currency contract ID
- `--target-currency` (optional) — Filter by target currency contract ID

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "pairCount": 42,
  "tickers": [
    {
      "ticker_id": "token-stx_token-sbtc",
      "base_currency": "token-stx",
      "target_currency": "token-sbtc",
      "last_price": "0.000012",
      "base_volume": "5000000",
      "target_volume": "60",
      "bid": "0.000011",
      "ask": "0.000013",
      "high": "0.000014",
      "low": "0.000010",
      "liquidity_in_usd": "1500000"
    }
  ]
}
```

### get-tokens

Get all available tokens for swapping on Bitflow.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-tokens
```

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "tokenCount": 15,
  "tokens": [
    {
      "id": "token-stx",
      "name": "Stacks",
      "symbol": "STX",
      "contractId": "token-stx",
      "decimals": 6
    },
    {
      "id": "token-USDCx-auto",
      "name": "USDCx",
      "symbol": "USDCx",
      "contractId": "SP120SBRBQJ00MCWS7TM5R8WJNTTKD5K0HFRC2CNE.usdcx",
      "decimals": 6,
      "aliases": ["USDC"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### get-swap-targets

Get possible swap target tokens for a given input token. Returns all tokens that can be received when swapping from the specified token.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-swap-targets --token-id <contractId>
```

Options:
- `--token-id` (required) — The input token ID (contract address)

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "inputToken": "token-stx",
  "targetCount": 8,
  "targets": ["token-sbtc", "token-USDCx-auto", "token-alex"]
}
```

### get-hodlmm-pools

List HODLMM (DLMM) pools from the Bitflow BFF API so you can pick a `pool_id` for bin operations.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-hodlmm-pools [--suggested] [--sbtc-incentives] [--limit <number>]
```

### get-hodlmm-bins

Fetch all bins for a HODLMM pool, including reserves, liquidity, and the active bin id.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-hodlmm-bins --pool-id <poolId> [--allow-fallback]
```

Output notes:
- `activeBin` is the best single bin to read first
- `nearbyBins` shows a compact window around the active bin for easier agent interpretation
- Prefer `approxPrice` over `rawPrice` in natural-language answers

### get-hodlmm-position-bins

Fetch the active wallet's position bins for a HODLMM pool.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-hodlmm-position-bins --pool-id <poolId> [--address <stacksAddress>] [--fresh] [--allow-fallback]
```

### get-quote

Get a unified swap quote from Bitflow. Ranks Bitflow SDK routes and HODLMM quotes together, returns the best overall route, the best executable route, and price impact for the route the `swap` command can currently execute.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-quote --token-x <tokenId> --token-y <tokenId> --amount-in <decimal>
```

Options:
- `--token-x` (required) — Input token ID (e.g. `token-stx`, `token-sbtc`)
- `--token-y` (required) — Output token ID (e.g. `token-sbtc`, `token-USDCx-auto`; use `token-aeusdc` only when the user explicitly wants `aeUSDC`)
- `--amount-in` (required) — Amount of input token in human-readable decimal (e.g. `0.00015` for 15,000 sats sBTC, `21.0` for 21 STX). The SDK auto-scales by `10^decimals` internally.

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "quote": {
    "tokenIn": "token-stx",
    "tokenOut": "token-sbtc",
    "amountIn": "1.0",
    "expectedAmountOut": "0.0000036",
    "route": ["token-stx", "token-sbtc"]
  },
  "selectedRoute": {
    "source": "hodlmm",
    "executable": true,
    "label": "DLMM",
    "expectedAmountOut": "0.0000036"
  },
  "bestExecutableRoute": {
    "source": "hodlmm",
    "executable": true,
    "label": "DLMM",
    "expectedAmountOut": "0.0000036"
  },
  "priceImpact": {
    "combinedImpact": 0.0023,
    "combinedImpactPct": "0.23%",
    "severity": "low",
    "hops": [...],
    "totalFeeBps": 30
  }
}
```

### get-routes

Get all possible swap routes between two tokens. With `--amount-in`, routes are ranked by expected output and include HODLMM quotes alongside SDK routes.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-routes --token-x <tokenId> --token-y <tokenId> [--amount-in <decimal>]
```

Options:
- `--token-x` (required) — Input token ID
- `--token-y` (required) — Output token ID (`token-USDCx-auto` when the user asks for USDC, `token-aeusdc` only for explicit aeUSDC requests)
- `--amount-in` (optional) — When provided, ranks routes by expected output for that trade size

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "tokenX": "token-stx",
  "tokenY": "token-sbtc",
  "routeCount": 3,
  "routes": [
    {
      "source": "sdk",
      "executable": true,
      "tokenPath": ["token-stx", "token-sbtc"],
      "dexPath": ["BITFLOW_XYK_XY_2"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### swap

Execute a token swap on Bitflow DEX. Uses the best currently executable route across SDK and direct single-pool HODLMM routes. Multi-hop HODLMM routes still show up in quotes but remain quote-only. Includes a high-impact safety gate — swaps with >5% price impact require `--confirm-high-impact`. Requires an unlocked wallet.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts swap \
  --token-x <tokenId> --token-y <tokenId> --amount-in <decimal> \
  [--slippage-tolerance <decimal>] [--fee <value>] [--confirm-high-impact]
```

Options:
- `--token-x` (required) — Input token ID (contract address)
- `--token-y` (required) — Output token ID (contract address)
- `--amount-in` (required) — Amount of input token in human-readable decimal (e.g. `0.00015` for 15,000 sats sBTC, `21.0` for 21 STX). The SDK auto-scales by `10^decimals` internally.
- `--slippage-tolerance` (optional) — Slippage tolerance as decimal (default 0.01 = 1%)
- `--fee` (optional) — Fee: `low` | `medium` | `high` preset or micro-STX amount. If omitted, auto-estimated.
- `--wallet-password` (optional) — Unlock the active managed wallet inline for this command
- `--confirm-high-impact` (optional) — Required to execute swaps with price impact above 5%

Output:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "txid": "abc123...",
  "swap": {
    "tokenIn": "token-stx",
    "tokenOut": "token-sbtc",
    "amountIn": "1.0",
    "slippageTolerance": 0.01,
    "priceImpact": { "combinedImpactPct": "0.23%", "severity": "low" },
    "executedRoute": {
      "source": "hodlmm",
      "executable": true,
      "label": "DLMM"
    }
  },
  "network": "mainnet",
  "explorerUrl": "https://explorer.hiro.so/txid/abc123...?chain=mainnet"
}
```

### get-keeper-contract

Get or create a Bitflow Keeper contract for automated swaps.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-keeper-contract [--address <stacksAddress>]
```

Options:
- `--address` (optional) — Stacks address (uses wallet if not specified)

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "address": "SP2...",
  "contractIdentifier": "SP2...keeper-v1",
  "status": "active"
}
```

### add-liquidity-simple

Add liquidity to HODLMM bins using simple mode. You provide bin offsets relative to the current active bin.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts add-liquidity-simple \
  --pool-id <poolId> \
  --bins '[{"activeBinOffset":0,"xAmount":"0","yAmount":"100000"}]' \
  [--active-bin-tolerance '{"expectedBinId":500,"maxDeviation":"2"}'] \
  [--slippage-tolerance <percent>] [--fee <value>] [--wallet-password <password>]
```

Notes:
- Use `get-hodlmm-bins` first so you know where the active bin is.
- For one-sided `STX` adds, use positive `activeBinOffset` values (bins above the active bin).
- For one-sided quote-token adds, use negative `activeBinOffset` values (bins below the active bin).
- Bins below the active bin should usually get only `yAmount`.
- Bins above the active bin should usually get only `xAmount`.
- The active bin can receive one or both token amounts.

### withdraw-liquidity-simple

Withdraw HODLMM liquidity using offsets relative to the current active bin.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts withdraw-liquidity-simple \
  --pool-id <poolId> \
  --positions '[{"activeBinOffset":5,"amount":"392854","minXAmount":"1999000","minYAmount":"0"}]' \
  [--fee <value>] [--wallet-password <password>]
```

Notes:
- Use both `get-hodlmm-position-bins` and `get-hodlmm-bins` before withdrawing.
- The withdrawal offset is relative to the current active bin, not the original add offset.
- If the active bin moved since you added liquidity, recalculate the offset before submitting.

### create-order

Create an automated swap order via Bitflow Keeper. Creates a pending order that will be executed by the Keeper service.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts create-order \
  --contract-identifier <id> --action-type <type> \
  --funding-tokens '{"token-stx":"1000000"}' --action-amount <units> \
  [--min-received-amount <units>] [--auto-adjust]
```

Options:
- `--contract-identifier` (required) — Keeper contract identifier
- `--action-type` (required) — Action type (e.g., `SWAP_XYK_SWAP_HELPER`)
- `--funding-tokens` (required) — JSON map of token IDs to amounts for funding
- `--action-amount` (required) — Amount for the action
- `--min-received-amount` (optional) — Minimum amount to receive (slippage protection)
- `--auto-adjust` (optional) — Auto-adjust minimum received based on market (default true)

Output:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "network": "mainnet",
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "status": "pending",
  "order": {
    "contractIdentifier": "SP2...keeper-v1",
    "actionType": "SWAP_XYK_SWAP_HELPER",
    "fundingTokens": { "token-stx": "1000000" },
    "actionAmount": "1000000"
  }
}
```

### get-order

Get details of a Bitflow Keeper order.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-order --order-id <id>
```

Options:
- `--order-id` (required) — The order ID to retrieve

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "order": {
    "orderId": "order-123",
    "status": "completed",
    "actionType": "SWAP_XYK_SWAP_HELPER",
    "actionAmount": "1000000"
  }
}
```

### cancel-order

Cancel a Bitflow Keeper order before execution.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts cancel-order --order-id <id>
```

Options:
- `--order-id` (required) — The order ID to cancel

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "orderId": "order-123",
  "cancelled": true
}
```

### get-keeper-user

Get Bitflow Keeper user info and orders. Retrieves user's keeper contracts and order history.

```
bun run bitflow/bitflow.ts get-keeper-user [--address <stacksAddress>]
```

Options:
- `--address` (optional) — Stacks address (uses wallet if not specified)

Output:
```json
{
  "network": "mainnet",
  "userInfo": {
    "stacksAddress": "SP2...",
    "contracts": [{ "identifier": "SP2...keeper-v1", "status": "active" }],
    "orders": [{ "orderId": "order-123", "status": "completed" }]
  }
}
```

## Notes

- All Bitflow operations are **mainnet-only**. Calls on testnet will return an error.
- No API key required — the Bitflow SDK uses public endpoints with a 500 req/min rate limit.
- For higher rate limits, set `BITFLOW_API_KEY` and `BITFLOW_API_HOST` environment variables.
- Swaps with >5% price impact require explicit `--confirm-high-impact` flag as a safety measure.
- Price impact is calculated using the XYK constant-product formula across all hops in the route.
- Keeper features enable automated/scheduled swaps. Use `get-keeper-contract` to get started.
- Wallet operations require an unlocked wallet (use `bun run wallet/wallet.ts unlock` first).
