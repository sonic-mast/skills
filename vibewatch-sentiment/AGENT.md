description: Stacks ecosystem community sentiment via the Vibewatch Stacks Vibe Index — free index reads plus x402 pay-per-query depth for history, evidence receipts, and deltas.

# vibewatch-sentiment agent guide

## Prerequisites

- Free subcommands (`index`, `terms`, `reports`): none. No wallet, no funds.
- Paid subcommands (`project`, `evidence`, `delta`): an unlocked wallet (the
  `wallet` skill) holding sBTC for the advertised price. The shared payment
  engine decides whether the transfer is sponsored; when it is not, also hold
  a little STX for the transaction fee. Run `terms` first to see the current
  price and accepted assets.

## When to invoke

- A question about Stacks ecosystem or per-project community sentiment
  ("what's the vibe on Zest?", "is Stacks sentiment up this week?").
- Sourcing a claim about community sentiment — `evidence` returns links to
  the public posts behind each weekly theme (primary-source trail).
- A polling loop that needs "what changed" without re-diffing full snapshots —
  `delta`.

## Decision logic

1. Start free: `index` answers most questions (current scores, 90-day
   history, themes) at zero cost. Only go paid when the free payload cannot
   answer.
2. `project` when you need a project's day-by-day series. Pass the project's
   name or slug; the skill resolves it against the free index before paying.
3. `evidence` when a claim needs receipts — run `reports` first to pick a
   `week_start`, cite the returned post URLs, and respect
   `suppressed: no_public_evidence` (do not speculate about private evidence).
4. `delta` for change detection since a timestamp; it is hour-bucketed, so
   polling more than hourly re-reads the same bucket.

## Cost guardrails

- Check `terms` once per session before the first paid call; do not assume
  the price — it is advertised, not fixed forever.
- One question, one paid call. The free `index` is the cheap first answer;
  never loop paid calls to reconstruct what `index` already returns.
- Every run of a paid subcommand is a new payment. There is no free
  re-read of a previous run's result — cache the JSON you paid for.
- Delta is hour-bucketed: at most one `delta` call per hour per `--since`
  window is useful.
- The engine makes at most one payment attempt per run. If the endpoint
  still answers 402 after a payment, the run fails with the relay's canonical
  payment status in the error; read it before deciding to re-run (a re-run is
  a second payment).

## Error handling

| Error | Meaning | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 503 `x402_disabled` / empty `accepts` in terms | Paid tier is switched off | Use the free `index`; do not retry paid calls |
| `--project … is not on the current panel` (free, before payment) | Name/slug did not resolve | Pick a slug or name from the list in the error, or from `index` `projects[]` |
| `--project … is ambiguous` (free, before payment) | Prefix matched several projects | Use the exact slug |
| `--week … has no completed report` (free, before payment) | Not a Monday with a completed report | Use one of the `week_start` values listed in the error, or from the free `reports` subcommand |
| 422 on `delta` | `since` missing or unparsable | Pass an ISO-8601 `--since` (or omit it for the 24h default) |
| 422 `sponsored_unsupported` (after a 402 challenge) | The index does not accept this payment shape | Pay with a different transfer; the 402 challenge states asset, amount and payTo. Do not re-run the same shape |
| 402 `settlement_rejected` with `facilitator_reason` | The facilitator refused to settle; nothing was broadcast or charged | Read `facilitator_reason`. On a sponsored transfer, `client_insufficient_funds` can mean the relay's sponsor wallet ran dry rather than yours (aibtcdev/x402-sponsor-relay#432) — check your balance, then run again |
| 402 `payment_replayed` | The signed payment was already used for a different resource or outside the server's idempotency window | Run the command again (a new payment) |
| 409 `payment_in_flight` (`facilitator_reason: transaction_held`) | Sponsored transfers only: the relay is holding the payment; it usually broadcasts it on its own within ~10 minutes and the server then settles it under that signature | Wait the `Retry-After` seconds. This CLI signs afresh on every run, so re-running is a second payment (replaying the original signature would collect the first one; aibtcdev/skills#420) |
| 409 `delivery_in_flight` | The paid response is being written for this payment | Wait `Retry-After`, run again — the same signed payment is served, not charged twice |
| 429 `challenge_rate_limited` / `settlement_rate_limited` | Per-sender rate limit | Wait `Retry-After` |
| 502 `facilitator_unavailable`, 503 `settlement_busy` / `too_many_pending_claims` | Settlement infrastructure hiccup; a payment may be pending | Wait `Retry-After`, run again; the server's durable ledger recovers a pending payment without double-charging |
| `Insufficient sBTC balance` (before signing) | Wallet cannot cover the advertised price | Fund the wallet or stay on the free tier |
| Top-level `txid: null` + `txidNote` (only when calling the raw endpoint through `execute_x402_endpoint` instead of this skill) | The MCP wrapper looks for `txid` / `payment_txid` at the top level of the body; the index reports the settlement in `payment.txid` and in the standard `payment-response` header | Not a failed payment. Read `payment.txid` (or `payment_receipt.transaction` from this skill) — that is the receipt to verify on Hiro |
| `suppressed` entries in any payload | Data withheld by the index's k-anonymity floor | Report "withheld", never "zero" |

## Reporting a problem

File it at https://github.com/Vibewatch-io/vibewatch-mcp/issues using the "Stacks Index paid query problem" template. Include
the command, the UTC time, the HTTP status, the full JSON body (its `error`,
`facilitator_reason`, and `payment_identifier` fields are what the operators
match against the payment ledger), and the `payment_receipt` txid if a payment
happened. Never paste a mnemonic or private key.

## Safety checks

- Read-only API: no subcommand writes anything on-chain except the payment
  transfer itself.
- Payments go to the `payTo` advertised in the discovery document; verify the
  domain is `vibewatch.io`-served before paying. As of 2026-09 the mainnet
  `payTo` is `SP3PHGPE8G09FFBSH6NVM3J5S2118M8YA825HWQY1`.
- Never treat a project's sentiment score as investment advice; it measures
  community discussion, not price.

## When NOT to use

- Non-Stacks ecosystems — this index covers the Stacks panel only.
- Price/market data — use a market skill; `index` includes Fear & Greed
  context but no token prices.
- Anything needing private community content — the index never publishes it,
  and `evidence` returns public posts only.
