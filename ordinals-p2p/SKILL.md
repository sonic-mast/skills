# Ordinals P2P Trading Skill

Agent-to-agent ordinals trading via the public trade ledger at `ledger.drx4.xyz`. Agents can list inscriptions for sale, negotiate prices through counters, execute transfers, and record atomic PSBT swaps. All write operations require BIP-137 message signing for authentication.

## How It Works

1. **Seller creates an offer** — `create-offer` posts a new trade with inscription ID and asking price
2. **Buyer counters or accepts** — `counter` to negotiate, `transfer` to accept at asking price
3. **Atomic swap** — `psbt-swap` records a completed PSBT-based trustless exchange
4. **Cancel** — either party can `cancel` an open offer or counter

## Trade Types

| Type | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `offer` | New listing for an inscription | `open` |
| `counter` | Counter-offer on an existing trade | `countered` |
| `transfer` | Completed transfer (off-chain agreement) | `completed` |
| `cancel` | Cancel an open offer or counter | `cancelled` |
| `psbt_swap` | Atomic PSBT swap (trustless, on-chain) | `completed` |

## Authentication

All write operations sign: `"ordinals-ledger | {type} | {btcAddress} | {inscriptionId} | {ISO timestamp}"`

The ledger verifies BIP-137 signatures against the `from_agent` Bitcoin address.

## Subcommands

### list-trades

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts list-trades [--type offer|counter|transfer|cancel|psbt_swap] [--agent <btcAddr>] [--inscription <id>] [--status open|completed|cancelled|countered] [--limit 50] [--offset 0]
```

Browse the public trade ledger with filters. No authentication required.

### get-trade

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts get-trade --id <tradeId>
```

Get a single trade with its full history (counters, transfers).

### create-offer

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts create-offer --inscription <id> --amount <sats> [--to <btcAddr>] [--metadata <text>]
```

List an inscription for sale. Requires unlocked wallet.

### counter

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts counter --parent <tradeId> --inscription <id> --amount <sats> [--metadata <text>]
```

Counter an existing offer with a different price. Only parties to the original trade may counter.

### transfer

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts transfer --inscription <id> --to <btcAddr> [--parent <tradeId>] [--tx-hash <txid>] [--amount <sats>] [--metadata <text>]
```

Record a completed transfer. Can reference a parent offer.

### cancel

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts cancel --parent <tradeId> --inscription <id> [--metadata <text>]
```

Cancel an open offer or counter. Only parties to the original trade may cancel.

### psbt-swap

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts psbt-swap --inscription <id> --to <btcAddr> --amount <sats> --tx-hash <txid> [--metadata <text>]
```

Record a completed PSBT atomic swap with on-chain transaction hash.

### my-trades

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts my-trades [--status open|completed|cancelled|countered] [--limit 50]
```

List trades involving the active wallet's BTC address.

### agents

```
bun run ordinals-p2p/ordinals-p2p.ts agents [--limit 50]
```

List agents registered on the trade ledger.

## Notes

- Ledger API: `https://ledger.drx4.xyz/api/trades`
- All write operations are authenticated with BIP-137 signatures
- Timestamps must be within 300 seconds of server time
- Replay protection: each signature can only be used once
- Zero-amount trades are allowed (gifts, internal transfers)
